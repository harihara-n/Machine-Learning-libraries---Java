                        ml - Machine Learning Package

  What is it?
  -----------

  The ml package contains a list of libraries that can be used for supervised
  learning. All the libraries are developed in Java. It was developed by me
  (Harihara Narayanan) as part of my grad class in Machine learning. The main
  purpose of this package is to enable people to use various classifiers without
  worrying about the internal details.  

  Documentation
  -------------

  The documentation for the libraries can be found in the Documentation file inside
  the same repository.
